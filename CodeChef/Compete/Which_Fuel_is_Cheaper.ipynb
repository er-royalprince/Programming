Since $A=1$ and $B=1$, the prices of both petrol and diesel increase by $1$ rupee at the start of every month. So, at the start of the first month, the price of petrol becomes $1+1=2$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $1+1=2$ rupees.

Since $A=2$ and $B=1$, the price of petrol increases by $2$ rupee and the price of diesel increases by $1$ rupee at the start of every month. It follows that at the start of the first month, the price of petrol becomes $2+2=4$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $1+1=2$ rupees. And by the start of the second month, the price of petrol becomes $4+2=6$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $2+1=3$ rupees. By the end of the second month, the prices of petrol and diesel are $6$ rupees and $3$ rupees respectively and hence diesel is cheaper than petrol.\n","\n","##**Test case 3:**\n","\n","Initially, the price of petrol is $2$ rupee and the price of diesel is $2$ rupee.

It follows that at the start of the first month, the price of petrol becomes $2+1=3$ rupees and the price of diesel becomes $2+1=3$ rupees.
