They pick a number and check to see if it is a power of $2$. If it is, they divide it by $2$. If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of $2$. Whoever reduces the number to $1$ wins the game. Louise always starts.\n","\n","Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.\n","\n","###**Example**\n","$n =132$\n","\n","It's Louise's turn first. She determines that $132$ is not a power of $2$. The next lower power of $2$ is $128$, so she subtracts that from $132$ and passes $4$ to Richard. $4$ is a power of $2$, so Richard divides it by $2$ and passes $2$ to Louise. Likewise,$2$  is a power so she divides it by $2$ and reaches $1$. She wins the game.\n","\n","**Update** If they initially set counter to $1$, Richard wins.
