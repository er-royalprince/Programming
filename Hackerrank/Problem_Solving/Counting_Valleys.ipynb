During the last hike that took exactly $steps$ steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, $U$, or a downhill, $D$ step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a $1$ unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:\n","\n","* A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.\n","\n","* A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.\n","\n","Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.\n","\n","##**Example**\n","\n","$steps = 8 \\ path = [DDUUUUDD]$\n","\n","The hiker first enters a valley $2$ units deep.
